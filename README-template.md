### What I learned

## What I Learned

During the development of this project, I learned about the following tools and concepts:

- **nanoid**: I explored how to use `nanoid` to generate unique, secure, and URL-friendly IDs for my to-do items. It provided a simple and efficient way to handle unique identifiers without the overhead of larger libraries.

- **dnd-kit**: I learned to implement drag-and-drop functionality using `dnd-kit`. It allowed me to create a dynamic and interactive user experience with sortable and draggable components, which greatly enhanced the usability of the app.
